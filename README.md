# landing-page

This is my first simple webpage project layout using html and css.

# The webpage layout consists of five parts:
1. Header section with the header text,links,button and an image.
2. Information section with few images with text below them.
3. Quote section that includes some quote text and the name of the author.
4. Call to action section with text and a button.
5. Footer with text and copyright symbol
